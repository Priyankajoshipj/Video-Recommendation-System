380,'event','en',374,'2005-10-03','2007-02-24','Inverse Problems Workshop 2005 - Touluse','What statisticians, numericians, engineers or econometricians mean by \"inverse problem\" often differs. For a statistician, an inverse problem is an estimation problem of a function which is not directly observed. The data are finite in number and contain errors, whose variance decreases with the number of observations, as they do in classical inference problems, while the unknown typically is infinite dimensional, as it is in nonparametric regression. For numericians, the noise is more an error induced by the fact that the real data are not directly observed. But the asymptotics differ, as the regularity conditions imposed for the solution. Finally, in econometrics the structural approach combines data observation and economic model. The parameter of interest is defined as a solution of a functional equation depending on the data distribution. Hence the operator in the underlying inverse problem is in general unknown. Many questions arise naturally in all the different fields, which are of great both applied and theoretical interest: identifiability, consistency and optimality in various forms, iterative methods. There have been great advances in the study of inverse problems within these three communities and we think that it is time for a workshop where the different point of views could be confronted, leading to exchanges of methodologies and several improvements. For instance non linear inverse problems have been studied in numerical analysis while statistical literature on this topics is scarce. Unknown inverse operators are common in econometrics but the problem is not well studied in statistics. On the other hand, adaptive estimation and optimal rates of convergence are common in statistics but not in the other fields.'

In all these paradigms, distinct methods have been developed to deal with inference when the models under consideration can be arbitrarily large. Recently, there has been a fruitful cross-fertilization of ideas and proof techniques. To give but one example, very recently, minimax optimal convergence rates of the information-theoretic MDL method were proved using ideas from the - computational - PAC-Bayesian paradigm and - statistical - empirical process techniques. The goal of this workshop is to bring together leading theoreticians to allow them to debate, compare and cross-fertilise ideas from these distinct inductive principles.

Structured representations can give a more informative view of input domains, which is crucial for the development of successful learning algorithms: application areas include determining protein structure and protein-protein interaction; part-of-speech tagging; the organization of web documents into hierarchies; and image segmentation. Likewise, a major research direction is in the use of structured output representations, which have been applied in a broad range of areas including several of the foregoing examples (for instance, the output required of the learning algorithm may be a probabilistic model, a graph, or a ranking). \\\\ Large Scale Kernel Machines \\\\ Datasets with millions of observations can be gathered by crawling the web, mining business databases, or connecting a cheap video tuner to a laptop. Vastly more ambitious learning systems are theoretically possible. The literature shows no shortage of ideas for sophisticated statistical models. The computational cost of learning algorithms is now the bottleneck. During the last decade, dataset size has outgrown processor speed. Meanwhile, machine learning algorithms became more principled, and also more computationally expensive.'

A procedure for classification is to be learned from a training set (X1, Y1) , ... , (Xn , Yn ). In the statistical literature on classification, the training set is traditionally seen as an i.i.d. sample from the distribution P of (X,Y), but one otherwise does not assume any a priori knowledge on P. Theoretical results have been derived that hold no matter what P is, which typically means that such results concentrate on worst cases. There are various reasons to step aside from this so-called black box approach. For example, the by now generally accepted rule ``regression is harder that classification\" has led to a bad name for certain \"plug in\" methods, although under distributional assumptions the latter are at least competitive with ``direct\" methods. Moreover, theoretical results for a case where P is assumed to be within a small class, can give benchmarks on what one may hope for. Also, procedures which adapt to properties of P need further exploration. These procedures are designed to work well in case one is \"lucky\", and are as such also inspired by having certain distributional assumptions in the back of ones mind. It moreover is often quite reasonable to assume some knowledge of the marginal distribution of X.'

This immediately raises the fundamental problem of trading off exploration and exploitation in that as information is learnt the system may be tempted to act in line with this insight rather than further exploring alternatives. Machine learning has developed a number of models that attempt to capture and analyse this trade-off, from the simplest bandit problem to the full Markov decision processes underlying reinforcement learning. The workshop would include tutorials covering the bandit analysis as well as its relevance to user modelling. Reinforcement learning would also be included with particular emphasis on applications in user interfaces. It is also hoped to launch a challenge in this area.

You will learn how to use advanced techniques to understand the robust, adaptive and self-organising properties of biological and natural systems, and also how to exploit these properties to address the pressing problems presented by the increasing scale and connectivity of today\'s engineered systems. The course focuses on developing core mathematical modelling and simulation skills, providing a firm knowledge base in relevant biology, and command of established techniques in biologically inspired computing.'

As in the previous challenge, the main task is judging whether a hypothesis (H) is entailed by a text (T). One of the main goals for the RTE-2 dataset is to provide more \"realistic\" text-hypothesis examples, based mostly on outputs of actual systems. We focus on the four application settings mentioned above: QA, IR, IE and multi-document summarization. Each portion of the dataset includes typical T-H examples that correspond to success and failure cases of such applications. The examples represent different levels of entailment reasoning, such as lexical, syntactic, morphological and logical.'

On-line design of individualised presentations that surpass the limits of the ”one size fits all” approaches can be made possible by user modeling techniques. Building models of users can be done throughMachine Learning, but this requires techniques that are specific to the task.One particular issue is that the user models cannot remain static, in the sense that during the use of the intended interaction more knowledge can be gathered which should in turn be used to improve the user models.

For instance, retrieval systems entirely depend on such a function to rank the documents with respect to their estimated similarity to the submitted query. Another example is kernel-based algorithms which heavily rely on the choice of an appropriate kernel function. In most cases, the choice of the comparison function (also called, depending on the context and its mathematical properties, distance metric, similarity measure, kernel function or matching measure) is done a-priori, relying on some knowledge/assumptions specific to the task. An alternative to this a-priori selection is to learn a suitable function relying on a set of examples and some of its desired properties. This workshop is aimed at bringing together researchers interested in such a task.'

The use of classifiers for decoding has emerged as a powerful technique that enables researchers to make predictions about the mental state of a subject directly from fMRI data. This work has received considerable attention because it is seen as a way to overcome limitations of more conventional fMRI analysis methods. Whereas conventional fMRI research is focused on spatially localising cognitive modules, decoding-based research allows for the first time the study of the neural encoding of specific mental contents in the human brain.\n \n The recent progress has also raised a number of fundamental questions, about the practice of decoding, the interpretation of results and their implications for theories of cognitive neuroscience. At a high level, one would like to know how decoding can help model-building in cognitive neuroscience and, ultimately, help develop theories of neural representation that explain the decoding-identified structure in the fMRI data. Conversely, we have the question of whether classifiers can be used as a confirmatory scientific tool for existing theories or hypotheses.\n \n We think that, given the number and type of specific open questions, this is more than just another application domain and thus there is space for machine learning researchers to come up with new methods or creative application and combination of existing ones. This workshop is designed to facilitate their entry into this field and put them in contact with cognitive neuroscientists receptive to their methods, as well as provide a venue for discussion of those questions as a possible agenda for the field.'
2350,'event','en',374,'2006-12-08','2007-02-24','On-line Trading of Exploration and Exploitation 2006 - Whistler','Trading exploration and exploitation plays a key role in a number of learning tasks. For example the bandit problem provides perhaps the simplest case in which we must decide a trade-off between pulling the arm that appears most advantageous and experimenting with arms for which we do not have accurate information. Similar issues arise in learning problems where the information received depends on the choices made by the learner. Learning studies have frequently concentrated on the final performance of the learned system rather than consider the errors made during the learning process. For example reinforcement learning has traditionally been concerned with showing convergence to an optimal policy, while in contrast analysis of the bandit problem has attempted to bound the extra loss experienced during the learning process when compared with an a priori optimal agent. This workshop provides a focus for work concerned with on-line trading of exploration and exploitation, in particular providing a forum for extensions to the bandit problem, invited presentations by researchers working in related areas in other disciplines, as well as discussion and contributed papers. \n \n '

Indeed many of the proofs of statistical consistency, etc., rely on this assumption. However, in practice we are very often faced with the situation where the training and the test data both follow the same conditional distribution, p(y|x), but the input distributions, p(x), differ. For example, principles of experimental design dictate that training data is acquired in a specific manner that bears little resemblance to the way the test inputs may later be generated. The aim of this workshop will be to try and shed light on the kind of situations where explicitly addressing the difference in the input distributions is beneficial, and on what the most sensible ways of doing this are.

2352,'event','en',374,'2006-12-09','2007-02-24','Dynamical Systems, Stochastic Processes and Bayesian Inference','The modelling of continuous-time dynamical systems from uncertain observations is an important task that comes up in a wide range of applications ranging from numerical weather prediction over finance to genetic networks and motion capture in video. Often, we may assume that the dynamical models are formulated by systems of differential equations. In a Bayesian approach, we may then incorporate a priori knowledge about the dynamics by providing probability distributions over the unknown functions, which correspond for example to driving forces and appear as coefficients or parameters in the differential equations. Hence, such functions become stochastic processes in a probabilistic Bayesian framework. Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a natural and flexible framework in such circumstances. The use of GPs in the learning of functions from data is now a well-established technique in Machine Learning. Nevertheless, their application to dynamical systems becomes highly nontrivial when the dynamics is nonlinear in the (Gaussian) parameter functions as closed form analytical posterior predictions (even in the case of Gaussian observation noise) are no longer possible. Moreover, their computation requires the entire underlying Gaussian latent process at all times (not just at the discrete observation times). Hence, inference of the dynamics would require nontrivial sampling methods or approximation techniques. The aim of this workshop is to provide a forum for discussing open problems related to stochastic dynamical systems, their links to Bayesian inference and their relevance to Machine Learning. '

A crucial problem for Systems Biology is that these parameters are often very difficult to measure directly. Furthermore, they may vary greatly according to their in vivo context. As a result, methods for the estimation of these parameters are of great interest. Standard approaches include maximum likelihood or least squares methods, using various optimisation heuristics such as simulated annealing and evolutionary algorithms. Although these approaches have had some success, it is very difficult to estimate the parameters when there are many interactions in the system under consideration. In this case the likelihood surface may have many local optima, the parameters may be poorly determined because there is not enough data, or there may be ambiguities brought about by symmetries or redundancy in the system.\n \n These same issues arise in machine learning. However, the problems in Systems Biology have an additional facet. In machine learning the models of interest are typically general function approximators, whereas in Systems Biology models are intended to provide a mechanistic description of the system, often using ordinary or stochastic differential equations.\n \n Recently, attention in machine learning and statistical inference has turned to parameter estimation in these models. The main goal of this workshop will be to bridge the divide between the fields by bringing together experts in machine learning and statistics with systems biologists and bioinformaticians. '

In particular in data clustering it is difficult to devise reasonable tools for this purpose - the most prominent example is the problem of choosing the number k of clusters one wants to construct. Stability-based methods and resampling methods have become a popular choice for model selection in clustering, which is documented by the wealth of literature on this topic. The basic rationale of those approaches is that valid models should be reproducible under perturbation or resampling of the data. If high instability of models is observed, the inferred solution does not seem to be a generally valid model, or at least seems to have missed some important aspects of the data. \\\\ Many scientists report that stability and resampling methods work well for clustering model selection. Moreover, for supervised learning there is a wealth of literature that proves that stable classification algorithms have a good generalization performance. On the other hand, it has recently been claimed that stability methods for clustering can be misleading and do not necessarily work the way people believe they do. There is still an ongoing debate on how those results should be interpreted. But many researchers working on clustering stability methods agree that there is a lack of theoretical understanding for stability methods in clustering. In particular it seems unclear in which situations stability works and what the mechanism is which makes it a successful tool in those situations. \\\\ This lack of understanding is the motivation for holding a workshop on stability and resampling methods for clustering. We plan to hold a rather small workshop for specialists working on stability questions for clustering, or on stability-related questions in other areas of computer science or mathematics. We want to have a small number of invited talks, but want to dedicate a considerable amount of time to discussions. Hopefully, combining the expertise of people working on different aspects of stability and resampling will lead to a deeper understanding of this tool and its role with respect to clustering.'

It is also an area in which the use of cognitive computational modelling has been especially intense. Language, and especially language acquisition, has been the key battleground for nativists and empiricists; and between advocates of rule-based, probabilistic, and connectionist models of thought. Yet the computational models proposed by CogSci researchers are often far behind, in scale and accuracy, the non-cognitively motivated models proposed by computational linguists, which are heavily based on machine learning techniques. \\\\ This workshop asks how far these techniques, and their theoretical underpinnings, provide tools for building richer theories of cognitive processes. For example, can powerful machine learning techniques (e.g. kernel methods) help build models of the cognitive operations involved in human language acquisition? Conversely, can insights from cognitive science help inform and focus computational linguistic and machine learning? Can evidence concerning the spectacular computational performance of the human language processor help inspire new generations of computational linguistic and machine learning tools? \\\\ This workshop will bring together participants from all of the disciplines that address this problem to discuss a range of related topics from methodological issues in computational modelling of language acquisition, including evaluation of empirical learning models, to technical problems in machine learning and grammatical inference. The workshop includes invited talks by some of the leading researchers in these fields.'

After many decades of focusing on independent and identically-distributed (iid) examples, many researchers are now studying problems in which examples consist of collections of inter-related entities or are linked together into complex graphs. A major driving force is the explosive growth in the amount of heterogeneous data that is being collected in the business and scientific world. Example domains include bioinformatics, chemoinformatics, transportation systems, communication networks, social network analysis, link analysis, robotics, among others. The structures encountered can be as simple as sequences and trees (such as those arising in protein secondary structure prediction and natural language parsing) or as complex as citation graphs, the World Wide Web, and even relational data bases. In all these cases, structured representations can give a more informative view of the problem at hand, which is often crucial for the development of successful mining and learning algorithms. We believe this is an ideal time for a workshop that allows active researchers in this area to discuss and debate the unique challenges of mining and learning from structured data. The MLG 2007 workshop will thus concentrate on mining and learning with structured data in general and its many appearances and facets such as interpretations, graphs, trees, sequences. Specifically, we seek to invite researchers in Statistical Relational Learning, Kernel Methods for Structured Inputs/Outputs, Graph Mining, (Multi-) Relational Data Mining, Inductive Logic Programming, among others.'

3142,'event','en',374,'2007-06-28','2007-09-07','Pascal Workshop on Graph Theory and Machine Learning','The focus of the workshop is on the fundamentals of graph theory relevant to learning, with emphasis on the applications of spectral clustering, visualisation and transductive learning. Methods from graph theory have made an impact in Machine Learning recently through two avenues. The first arises when we view the data samples as the vertices of the graph with the similarity between the examples encoded by the weights on the edges. This view of the data can be used to motivate a number of techniques, including spectral clustering, nonlinear dimensionality reduction, visualisation, transductive and semi-supervised classification. The second reason for involving graph theory is through the representation of complex objects by graphs. This could be for objects that have a natural graph structure such as molecules or gene networks, or for cases where a feature extraction phase constructs a graph, as for example in natural language processing or computer vision. A key development in this area has been the realisation that feature spaces involving exponentially many features can be used implicitly via kernels that compute in polynomial time inner products between projections into the feature space. This use of graph representations is becoming common in many applications of machine learning making a focus on this topic relevant to a number of application areas, particularly bioinformatics and natural language processing.

Recent scientific developments provide technologies to exploit these huge amounts of data and extract from it critical information. Used today in many commercial applications (marketing campaigns, user profiling and recommendations on e-commerce sites, web search,users communitiee...), these technologies can also be used for security-critical applications (fraud detection and money laundering, intrusions detection, intelligence gathering, terrorist networks detection, Web surveillance...). It is the purpose of this workshop to review the various technologies available (data mining algorithms, social networks, crawling and indexing, text-mining, search engines, data streams) in the context of very large data sets. The workshop will provide survey presentations & posters to help building a scientific community aware of security issues and techniques to solve them.'

Here, the connection between microscopic measurement and modeling to macroscopic observation shall be outlined. Second, we discuss issues of decomposition techniques applied on fMRI and EEG/MEG data. A present trend in this area is to increase the tensorial order of the data representation which, at least in principle, allows for unique decomposition under fairly mild conditions unless the data are \'pathological\'. A specific question here is whether real data are so close to being \'pathological\' that the decomposition lacks robustness. More generally, decomposition methods like PCA, ICA, Parafac or the construction of general \"dictionaries\" make different kinds of assumptions. The question is which of these assumptions are met in real data and whether or not some assumptions are useful to make even if they are not met. Third, a specific application of data analysis methods is the brain computer interface. In practice it appears that the most simple methods are surprisingly successful. One reason could be that uninteresting background noise is so complicated and diverse that ignoring the background as much as possible should have priority over interpreting details of the signal of interest. The respective priorities set the range of promising methods. We shall discuss in this workshop the present experience with various methods and the most promising directions of research to improve the results.'

Following the successful workshop held in Erice in 2005 - [[ref:aop05_erice]]  this new edition will combine an emphasis on the common principles of this discipline and a focus on its impact on modern science and technology. Automatically finding trends, anomalies, similarities and any other relation of interest in a dataset is a crucial task for theory and applications, where statistical and algorithmic ideas are intertwined, as well as ideas and methods from information theory, optimization, data mining and machine learning. Very often, different communities focus on different aspects or approaches, so that a general view of the problem is difficult to achieve. The goal of this course is precisely this: to bring together and compare different approaches to the problem of detecting and analyzing any type of patterns in any type of data. This course will deal with general themes arising from the analysis of patterns in different disciplines, theor impact on science and technology. The intended audience are students and researchers in statistcs, computer science, data mining, neural networks and data intensive sciences, interested in pattern analysis. The focus will be on unifying principles that underlie classic disciplines such as sequence pattern matching, pattern recognition by means of machine learning systems, etc.\n\n[[http://www.analysis-of-patterns.net/bertinoro_07/index.shtml]]'

In addition to defining such models, a means of objectively assessing the validity of competing hypotheses regarding pathway structures based on experimental data and prior knowledge is essential. As the models themselves will have been identified from experimental observations for which there is significant variability it is advisable to adopt a consistent grammar for scientific reasoning that will take account of this uncertainty. The Bayesian perspective is highly appropriate to enable consistent reasoning over mechanistic models of biological systems. However, given the intractable nature of the integrals required for an analytical Bayesian solution we are required to turn to Markov chain Monte Carlo or other approximating techniques to perform system identification and model-based reasoning. Practical solutions to these problems are critical to the utility and realism of systems biology models. The goal of this workshop will be to explore the main methodological and technical issues associated with performing Bayesian inference over mechanistic biochemical pathway models. It will bring together experts in systems biology, statistical inference and machine learning (through the PASCAL networks).'

These include in particular genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics devoted respectively to the examination of the entire systems of genes, transcripts, proteins and metabolites present in a given cell or tissue type. The availability of these new, highly effective tools for biological exploration is dramatically changing the way one performs research in at least two respects. First of all, the amount of available experimental data is not at all a limiting factor any more; on the contrary, there is a plethora of it. The challenge has shifted towards identifying the relevant pieces of information given the question, and how to make sense out of it (a \"data mining\" issue). Secondly, rather than to focus on components in isolation, we can now try to understand how biological systems behave as the result of the integration and interaction between the individual components that one can now monitor simultaneously (so called \"systems biology\"). Taking advantage of this wealth of \"genomic\" information has become a conditio sine qua non for whoever ambitions to remain competitive in molecular biology and more generally in biomedical sciences. Machine learning naturally appears as one of the main drivers of progress in this context, where most of the targets of interest deal with complex structured objects: sequences, 2D and 3D structures or interaction networks. At the same time bioinformatics and systems biology have already induced significant new developments of general interest in machine learning, for example in the context of learning with structured data, graph inference, semi-supervised learning, system identification, and novel combinations of optimization and learning algorithms. The aim of this workshop is to contribute to the cross-fertilization between the research in machine learning methods and their applications to complex biological and medical questions by bringing together method developers and experimentalists. We encourage submissions bringing forward methods for discovering complex structures (e.g. interaction networks, molecule structures) and methods supporting genome-wide data analysis.'

The discovery that actions and reactions are often disproportionate and that small perturbations can cause tremendous responses, has led to new scientific disciplines such as catastrophe theory, chaos theory, and the theory of phase transitions. The behavior of complex systems is often dominated by their internal dynamics and hence only poorly controllable from outside. This has been addressed by the concepts of self-organisation and emergence. In many cases, a complex system can even evolve into one out of several (meta-)stable states, which is in clear contrast to linearly behaving systems with a unique solution. In addition, random perturbations, diversity (heterogeneity) in the properties of the individual system elements, network effects, time delays, and incomplete or uncertain information can lead to unexpected and sometimes paradoxical effects. The recently established European Complex Systems Society and the series of conferences under the title \"European Conference on Complex Systems\" has to be seen in this context. It aims at bringing together the various related disciplines, at focusing the diverse research activities, and at fostering them. The goals of this annual conference are to reflect the recent progress in the field of complexity science and to significantly increase the actively involved community.

The main objective of observing the evolution patterns is to develop models that explain processes which govern the network evolution. Such models can then be fitted to real networks, and used to generate realistic graphs or give formal explanations about their properties. In addition, our work has a wide range of applications: we can spot anomalous graphs and outliers, design better graph sampling algorithms, forecast future graph structure and run simulations of network evolution.\n \n Another important aspect of this research is the study of ``local\'\' patterns and structures of propagation in networks. We aim to identify building blocks of the networks and find the patterns of influence that these block have on information or virus propagation over the network. Our recent work included the study of the spread of influence in a large person-to-person product recommendation network and its effect on purchases. We also model the propagation of information on the blogosphere, and propose algorithms to efficiently find influential nodes in the network.\n \n Further work will include three areas of research. We will continue investigating models for graph generation and evolution. Second, we will analyze large online communication networks and devise models on how user characteristics and geography relate to communication and network patterns. Third, we will extend the work on the propagation of influence in recommendation networks to blogs on the Web, studying how information spreads over the Web by finding influential blogs and analyzing their patterns of influence.'

The definition of music as organised sound is widely accepted today but a naïve interpretation of this definition may suggest the notion that music exists widely in the animal kingdom, from the rasping of crickets\' legs to the songs of the nightingale. However, only in the case of humans does music appear to be surplus to any obvious biological purpose, while at the same time being a strongly learned phenomenon and involving significant higher order cognitive processing rather than eliciting simple hardwired responses. A two day workshop will take place at NIPS 07 (Whistler, Canada) and will span topics from signal processing and musical structure to the cognition of music and sound. In the first day the workshop will provide a forum for cutting edge research addressing the fundamental challenges of modeling the structure of music and analysing its effect on the brain. It will also provide a venue for interaction between the machine learning and the neuroscience/brain imaging communities to discuss the broader questions related to modeling the dynamics of brain activity. During the second day the workshop will focus on the modeling of sound, music perception and cognition. These have provide, with the crucial role of machine learning, a break through in various areas of music technology, in particular: Music Information Retrieval (MIR), expressive music synthesis, interactive music making, and sound design. Understanding of music cognition in its implied top-down processes can help to decide which of the many descriptors in MIR are crucial for the musical experience and which are irrelevant. The target group is of researchers within the fields of (Music) Cognition, Music Technology, Machine Learning, Psychology, Sound Design, Signal Processing and Brain Imaging.

Nevertheless, it is not clear how modern machine learning approaches can either cope with such parallel machineries or take into account strong constraints regarding the available time to handle training and/or test examples. This workshop will explore two alternatives: (1) modern machine learning approaches that can handle real time processing at train and/or at test time, under strict computational constraints (when the flow of incoming data is continuous and needs to be handled), and (2) modern machine learning approaches that can take advantage of new commodity hardware such as multicore, GPUs, and fast networks.

On the other hand, a great variety of applications in machine learning and computer science require distribution estimation and/or comparison. Examples include testing for homogeneity (the \"two-sample problem\"), independence, and conditional independence, where the last two can be used to infer causality; data set squashing / data sketching / data anonymisation; domain adaptation (the transfer of knowledge learned on one domain to solving problems on another, related domain) and the related problem of covariate shift; message passing in graphical models (EP and related algorithms); compressed sensing; and links between divergence measures and loss functions. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together statisticians, machine learning researchers, and computer scientists working on representations of distributions for various inference and testing problems, to discuss the compromises necessary in obtaining useful results from finite data. In particular, what are the capabilities and weaknesses of different distribution estimates and comparison strategies, and what negative results apply?'

The proposed main theme of the conference is the interconnections of values and economy. **What is IAREP?** Founded in 1982, the **International Association for Research in Economic Psychology** (IAREP) is the natural meeting point for all those interested in the areas where psychology and economics intersect. It has a wide international membership, drawn from psychologists and economics, but also from specialists in business administration, marketing and consumer behaviour. \n\nThe Association\'s members include both academics and practitioners, and students are always encouraged to take part in our activities. The interests of the Association are broad. A few of our members would describe themselves as \"economic psychologists\", and work in departments or institutes of economic psychology. The majority, however, are simply experts in one discipline who recognize that neighbouring disciplines have something important to contribute to the areas they are interested in. We welcome anyone who takes this kind of open-minded approach to research. \n\nEconomic psychology is concerned both with the psychological mechanisms through which economic behaviour comes about, and with the psychological effects of economic events. While IAREP stresses the importance of empirical work, we also recognize the contribution both economic and psychological theory can make to interdisciplinary investigations. \nPerhaps the most important way IAREP works, however, is as //an informal network of friends and colleagues, which successfully crosses national and disciplinary frontiers//. Many joint research projects have been launched through discussions held at IAREP meetings, and many research publications have originated in the cross-fertilisation of ideas that occurs when people of different backgrounds meet and discuss common problems with an open mind.'

Does it, for example, add value to practitioners of translation, by teaching them something useful and allowing them to enhance their translation skills, or perhaps by enhancing their status in society? Does it contribute to translator training by offering useful training methods, assessment criteria or other elements?

Since real world data are typically noisy, ambiguous and occasionally erroneous, a central requirement of a learning system is that it must be able to handle uncertainty. Probability theory provides an ideal basis for representing and manipulating uncertain knowledge, so many successful algorithms in machine learning are based on probabilistic i.e. Bayesian inference. Bayesian inference provides a principled framework for machine learning, but exact inference is often intractable, so most algorithms rely on approximations such as variational methods or Markov chain Monte Carlo.\n----\n More > http://talks.cam.ac.uk/show/archive/9091 \n----'

The Conference and the associated technical workshop through exchange of ideas and emerging solution plan to offer a coherent approach to the Future of the Internet as a vehicle for excellence and innovation enabling the European actors of the Internet an opportunity to master and shape the future. The Conference is also an open a floor for a discussion of the conditions that must be created in order to help European enterprises to become global leaders in tomorrow\'s networking and service infrastructures and ensure that the markets are ready for emerging technologies and business models. In the context of this Conference, the European Union, notably through its i2010 strategic policy framework is clearly outlining its adherence to the openness, interoperability and end to end principles, governing the Internet. Even though many aspects of emerging networks and the Future Internet will not be realised for some time, obstacles to the development of the information society can already be identified and this Conference is a way to do it. These concern issues from investment in higher bandwidth, net neutrality, through spectrum availability to security.'

The explicit representation of the semantics of data, enriched with domain theories (ontologies), will enable a web that provides a qualitatively new level of service. It will weave together a large network of human knowledge and makes this knowledge machine-processable. Various automated services will help the users to achieve their goals by accessing and processing information in machine-understandable form. This network of knowledge systems will ultimately lead to truly intelligent systems, which will be employed for various complex decision-making tasks. Semantic Web research can benefit from ideas and cross-fertilization with many other areas: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Databases and Information Systems, Information Retrieval, Multimedia, Distributed Systems, Social Networks and Web Engineering. Many advances within these areas can contribute towards the realization of the Semantic Web.  **The continuing success of ESWC** as a premier publication place in the area of semantics has culminated in a record number of high-quality submissions for this year (275 submissions, 19% acceptance rate). **The 5th Annual European Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2008)** will present the latest results in research and applications of Semantic Web technologies.

5001,'event','en',374,'2008-05-27','2008-08-05','Approximate Inference in Stochastic Processes and Dynamical Systems','The modelling of continuous-time stochastic processes from uncertain (discrete) observations is an important task that arises in a wide range of applications, such as in climate modelling, tracking, finance and systems biology. Although observations are in general only available at discrete times, the underlying system is often a continuous-time one. Hence, the physics or the dynamics are formulated by systems of differential equations, the observation noise and the process uncertainty being modelled by several stochastic sources. When dealing with stochastic processes, it is natural to take a probabilistic approach. For example, we may incorporate prior knowledge about the dynamics by providing probability distributions on the unknown functions. In contrast to models that are only data driven, it is hoped that incorporating domain knowledge in the inference process will improve performance in practice. The main challenges in this context are how to deal with continuous-time objects, how to do inference and how to be agnostic about the deterministic driving forces and the sources of uncertainty. The workshop will provide a forum for discussing the open problems arising in dynamical systems, and in particular continuous-time stochastic processes. It will focus both on the mathematical aspects/theoretical advances and the applications. Another important aim is to bridge the gap between the different communities (data assimilation, machine learning, optimal control, systems biology, finance, ...) and favour interactions. Hence, the workshop will be of interest to researchers from statistics, computer science, mathematics, physics and engineering. We also hope that the workshop will provide new insights in this exciting field and serve as a starting point for new research perspectives and future collaborations. The workshop is sponsored by **PASCAL2 network of excellence** and is one of six workshops in the Thematic Programme in Leveraging Complex Prior Knowledge for Learning. ---- Event home page:> http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/C.Archambeau/AIS/ais.htm ----'

5136,'event','en',5251,'2008-03-26','2008-07-21','Interoperability for Enterprise Software and Applications / I-ESA 2008','Interoperability in the context of enterprise applications is the ability of a system or a product to work with other systems or products without special effort from the customer or user. The capability to interact and exchange information both internally and with external organisations (partners, suppliers, customers) is a key issue in the economic sector. It is fundamental in order to produce goods and services quickly and at lower cost, while ensuring higher levels of quality and customisation. Today, companies maximise flexibility and speed of response to changing market conditions, by focusing on core innovation and information centred activities, outsourcing capital and labour intensive activities to less advanced economies. They develop knowledge and links with other companies with which they can collaborate to provide the products and services that the market demands – the networked enterprise, or virtual organisation. Successful enterprises in this knowledge economy may be small, but are highly productive, focussed on innovation and capable of flexibly and rapidly sharing information and knowledge to participate in highly competitive networked enterprises. The issue of interoperability within the enterprise is therefore no longer limited to the interoperability between silos of systems within single companies, but has become one of interoperability throughout a value chain. I-ESA brings together the world’s leading researchers and practitioners in the area of enterprise interoperability, and it is a unique forum for the exchange of visions, ideas, research results and industrial experiences, dealing with a wealth of interoperability research subjects for business, enterprise applications and software. The industry will find at I-ESA’08 an outstanding opportunity to exchange experience and problems on business interoperability in their daily operations. I-ESA series of conferences have become a forum where industry and research worlds meet and share experience, ideas and problems on different interoperability aspects. In the I-ESA 08 arena the industry will point out the difficulties encountered in their business life and show the way taken to solve those problems while interrelate with other organizations sharing experience. The industry will be able to meet interoperability experts and learn from them about emerging new solutions and even establish relationships for further research and development and problem solving. Special sessions will address industrial interoperability issues for large scale industry like Automotive and Aeronautic and medium as well as small sized ones like Furniture. I-ESA´08 is certainly \"the event\" for those who want to know the future, the forefront of research and the industry expertise/viewpoint in this very important domain of \"Enterprise Interoperability and e-Business\".

This course focuses on the production of projects for public places. Public Art is a concept that is in constant discussion and revision, as much as the evolution and transformation of public spaces and cities are. Monuments are repositories of memory and historical presences with the expectation of being permanent. Public interventions are created not to impose and be temporary, but as forms intended to activate discourse and discussion. Considering the concept of a museum as a public device and how they are searching for new ways of avoiding generic identities, we will deal with the concept of the personal imaginary museum. It should be considered as a point of departure to propose a personal individual construction based on the concept of defining a personal imaginary museum - concept, program, collection, events, architecture, public diffusion, etc.\n\n**Course Highlights**\n\nThis course features videos from guest artists in the lecture notes section, and the student projects from the semester in the projects section.\n\n**Course Homepage** [[http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/architecture/4-367-studio-seminar-in-public-art-spring-2006/index.htm|4.367 Studio Seminar in Public Art Spring 2006]]\n\n**Course features at MIT OpenCourseWare page**:\n*[[http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/architecture/4-367-studio-seminar-in-public-art-spring-2006/syllabus|Syllabus]]\n*[[http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/architecture/4-367-studio-seminar-in-public-art-spring-2006/readings|Readings]]\n*[[http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/architecture/4-367-studio-seminar-in-public-art-spring-2006/lecture-notes|Lecture Notes]]\n*[[http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/architecture/4-367-studio-seminar-in-public-art-spring-2006/projects|Projects]]\n*[[http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/architecture/4-367-studio-seminar-in-public-art-spring-2006/download-course-materials|Download Course Materials]]\n\nAs part of the class, a document was created for publication.

The text is aimed at those who have seen Maxwell\'s equations in integral and differential form and who have been exposed to some integral theorems and differential operators. A hypertext version of this textbook can be found here. An accompanying set of video demonstrations is available below.\n\nThese video demonstrations convey electromagnetism concepts. The demonstrations are related to topics covered in the textbook. They were prepared by Markus Zahn, James R. Melcher, and Manuel L. Silva and were produced by the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nThe purpose of these demonstrations is to make mathematical analysis of electromagnetism take on physical meaning. Based on relatively simple configurations and arrangements of equipment, they make a direct connection between what has been analytically derived and what is observed. They permit the student to observe physically what has been described symbolically. Often presented with a plot of theoretical predictions that are compared to measured data, these demonstrations give the opportunity to test the range of validity of the theory and present a quantitative approach to dealing with the physical world.\n\nThe short form of these videos contains the demonstrations only. The long form also presents theory, diagrams, and calculations in support of the demonstrations.\n\n**Download all textbook PDFs [[http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-013-electromagnetics-and-applications-fall-2005/electromagnetic-field-theory-textbook/|Electromagnetic Field Theory Textbook]]**\n\n**Complete MIT OCW video collection at [[http://videolectures.net/mit_ocw/|MIT OpenCourseWare - VideoLectures.NET]]**'

The first phases mainly dealing with storing and efficiently accessing the data, resulted in the development of industry delivering tools for handling large databases, standardization of related processes, queering languages, etc. When the data storage was not a primary problem any more the need for improving the database organization resulted in the databases supporting not only transactions but also analytical views of the data.\n\nAt this point data warehousing with OLAP (On-Line-Analytical-Processing) entered as a usual part of a company information system. The OLAP paradigme stil requires from the user to set well defined questions which is not always easy and possible. This led to the development of Data Mining offering automatic data analysis trying to obtain some new information from the existing data and enabling the user some new insights in the data. Further development of methods for Text Mining enables handling textual data in addition to well structured data in databases.

Building on this growth, Semantic Web technologies aim at providing a shared semantic information space, changing qualitatively our experiences on the Web. As Semantic Web technologies mature and permeate more and more application areas, new research challenges are coming to the fore and some unsolved ones are becoming more acute. These issues include creating and managing Semantic Web content, making Semantic Web applications robust and scalable, organizing and integrating information from different sources for novel uses, making semantics explicit in order to improve our overall experience with information technologies, and thus enabling us to use the wealth of information that is currently available in digital form for addressing our everyday tasks.\n\nTo foster the exchange of ideas and collaboration, **ISWC** brings together researchers in relevant disciplines such as artificial intelligence, databases, social networks, distributed computing, web engineering, information systems, natural language processing, soft computing, and human-computer interaction.\n\n\n----\n**>** More about ISWC 2008 > http://iswc2008.semanticweb.org/\n----'

Its business is fundamental physics, finding out what the Universe is made of and how it works. At CERN, the world’s largest and most complex scientific instruments are used to study the basic constituents of matter — the fundamental particles. By studying what happens when these particles collide, physicists learn about the laws of Nature.\n\nThe instruments used at CERN are particle accelerators and detectors. Accelerators boost beams of particles to high energies before they are made to collide with each other or with stationary targets. Detectors observe and record the results of these collisions.\n\nFounded in 1954, the CERN Laboratory sits astride the Franco–Swiss border near Geneva. It was one of Europe’s first joint ventures and now has 20 Member States.'

In economical applications for instance, the revealed preference of market players is observed, and the analyst tries to understand them by a complex model by which the players\' behavior can be understood as an indirect observation. State-of-the art statistical approaches often formulate such models as inverse problems, but the corresponding methods can suffer of the curse of dimensionality: when there are \"too many\" possible explanatory variables, additional regularization is needed. Inverse problem theory already offers sophisticated regularization methods for smooth models, but is just beginning to integrate sparsity concepts. For high-dimensional linear models, sparsity regularizations have proved to be a convincing way to tackle the issue both in theory and practice, but there remains a vast ground to be explored. Paralleling the statistics community are also recent advances in machine learning methodology and statistical learning theory, where the themes of sparsity and inverse problems have been intertwined.\n\nThe workshop will focus on the different ways to attack a same question: there are many potential models to choose from, but each of them is relatively simple - each model is parameterized by many variables, most of them are zero. Yet, the choice of the right model or regularization parameter is crucial to obtain stable and reliable results.\n\n----\nmore about conference: > http://pluto.mscc.huji.ac.il/~yaacov/SparsityWorkshop/index.html\n----'

Following the success of the inaugural NIPS-MLOSS workshop held at NIPS 2006, the Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR) has started a new track for machine learning open source software initiated by the workshop\'s organizers. Many prominent machine learning researchers have co-authored a position paper advocating the need for open source software in machine learning. Furthermore, the workshop\'s organizers have set up a community website mloss.org where people can register their software projects, rate existing projects and initiate discussions about projects and related topics.

These data may include sequenced genomes of a variety of organisms, gene expression data from multiple technologies, protein expression data, protein sequence and 3D structural data, protein interactions, gene ontology and pathway databases, genetic variation data (such as SNPs), and an enormous amount of textual data in the biological and medical literature. New types of scientific and clinical problems require the development of novel supervised and unsupervised learning methods that can use these growing resources. \n\nThe goal of this workshop is to present emerging problems and machine learning techniques in computational biology.

Given observations that have been generated by an unknown stochastic dependency, the goal is to infer a law that will be able to correctly predict future observations generated by the same dependency. Statistics, in contrast, has traditionally focused on data modeling, i.e., on the estimation of a probability law that has generated the data. During recent years, the boundaries between the two disciplines have become blurred and both communities have adopted methods from the other, however, it is probably fair to say that neither of them has yet fully embraced the field of causal modeling, i.e., the detection of causal structure underlying the data. Since the Eighties there has been a community of researchers, mostly from statistics and philosophy, who have developed methods aiming at inferring causal relationships from observational data. While this community has remained relatively small, it has recently been complemented by a number of researchers from machine learning. \n\nThe goal of this workshop is to discuss new approaches to causal discovery from empirical data, their applications and methods to evaluate their success. Emphasis will be put on the definition of objectives to be reached and assessment methods to evaluate proposed solutions. The participants are encouraged to participate in a \"\"competition pot-luck\"\" in which datasets and problems will be exchanged and solutions proposed.\n\nMore information about workshop - http://clopinet.com/isabelle/Projects/NIPS2008'

Specifically we are interested in how far learned prediction rules may be characterized in terms of the observations themselves. This amounts to capturing how well data can be used to construct structured hypothesis spaces for risk minimization strategies - termed empirical hypothesis spaces. Classical analysis of learning algorithms requires the user to define a proper hypothesis space before seeing the data. In practice however, one often decides on the proper learning strategy or the form of the prediction rules of interest after inspection of the data. This theoretical gap constitutes exactly the scope of this workshop.\n\nMore information about workshop - http://www.kuleuven.be/wehys/'

Convex optimization has occupied the center-stage and significant effort continues to be still devoted to it. New problems constantly emerge in machine learning, e.g., structured learning and semi-supervised learning, while at the same time fundamental problems such as clustering and classification continue to be better understood. Moreover, machine learning is now very important for real-world problems with massive datasets, streaming inputs, the need for distributed computation, and complex models. \n\nThese challenging characteristics of modern problems and datasets indicate that we must go beyond the \"\"traditional optimization\"\" approaches common in machine learning. What is needed is optimization \"\"tuned\"\" for machine learning tasks. For example, techniques such as non-convex optimization (for semi-supervised learning, sparsity constraints), combinatorial optimization and relaxations (structured learning), stochastic optimization (massive datasets), decomposition techniques (parallel and distributed computation), and online learning (streaming inputs) are relevant in this setting. These techniques naturally draw inspiration from other fields, such as operations research, polyhedral combinatorics, theoretical computer science, and the optimization community.\n\nMore information about workshop - http://opt2008.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/'

Learning from multiple data sources (or alternatively, the data fusion problem) is a timely research area. Due to the increasing availability and sophistication of data recording techniques and advances in data analysis algorithms, there exists many scenarios in which it is necessary to model multiple, related data sources, i.e. in fields such as bioinformatics, multi-modal signal processing, information retrieval, sensor networks etc. \n\nThe open question is to find approaches to analyse data which consists of more than one set of observations (or view) of the same phenomenon. In general, existing methods use a discriminative approach, where a set of features for each data set is found in order to explicitly optimise some dependency criterion. However, a discriminative approach may result in an ad hoc algorithm, require regularisation to ensure erroneous shared features are not discovered, and it is difficult to incorporate prior knowledge about the shared information. A possible solution is to overcome these problems is a generative probabilistic approach, which models each data stream as a sum of a shared component and a private component that models the within-set variation. \n\nIn practice, related data sources may exhibit complex co-variation (for instance, audio and visual streams related to the same video) and therefore it is necessary to develop models that impose structured variation within and between data sources, rather than assuming a so-called \'flat\' data structure. Additional methodological challenges include determining what is the \'useful\' information to extract from the multiple data sources, and building models for predicting one data source given the others.

The appropriate choice of a kernel is often left to the user. But, poor selections may lead to sub-optimal performance. Furthermore, searching for an appropriate kernel manually may be a time-consuming and imperfect art. Instead, the kernel selection process can be included as part of the overall learning problem. In this way, better performance guarantees can be given and the kernel selection process can be made automatic. In this workshop, we will be concerned with using sampled data to select or learn a kernel function or kernel matrix appropriate for the specific task at hand. We will discuss several scenarios, including classification, regression, and ranking, where the use of kernels is ubiquitous, and different settings including inductive, transductive, or semi-supervised learning. \n\nWe also invite discussions on the closely related fields of features selection and extraction, and are interested in exploring further the connection with these topics. The goal is to cover all questions related to the problem of learning kernels: different problem formulations, the computational efficiency and accuracy of the algorithms that address these problems and their different strengths and weaknesses, and the theoretical guarantees provided. What is the computational complexity? Does it work in practice? The formulation of some other learning problems, e.g. multi-task learning problems, is often very similar. \n\nThese problems and their solutions will also be discussed in this workshop.\n\nMore information about workshop - http://www.cs.nyu.edu/learning_kernels'

Čeprav je literarno delo besedna umetnina in je njena primarna materija jezik, se vsakodnevno srečujemo z umetniškimi deli, kjer literatura prestopa meje svojega jezikovnega medija in postaja sestavni del filma, gledališke uprizoritve, glasbene popevke, umetniške slike, opere ipd. V letošnjem seminarju bomo tako razmišljali o tistih literarnih delih, po katerih so bili posneti slovenski filmi, razpravljali bomo o odnosu med dramskih besedilom in njegovo odrsko upodobitvijo, analizirali in poslušali uglasbene pesmi slovenskih pesnikov … , kar bomo v veliki meri vključili tudi v večerni program seminarja. Hkrati pa bomo spoznavali značilnosti jezika v gledališču in filmu, na televiziji, v publicistiki, oglaševanju ipd. Zato bomo poleg jezikoslovcev in literarnih zgodovinarjev kot predavatelje pritegnili tudi gledališke in filmske teoretike, muzikologe, sociologe, kulturologe in tako skušali z različnih vidikov osvetlili krovno temo.

Several methods have recently been developed in both fields, which rely upon the notion of sparsity (e.g. penalty methods like the Lasso, Dantzig selector, etc.). Many of the key theoretical ideas and statistical analysis of the methods have been developed independently, but there is increasing awareness of the potential for cross-fertilization of ideas between statistics and machine learning.\n\nFurthermore, there are interesting links between lasso-type methods and boosting (particularly, LP-boosting); there has been a renewed interest in sparse Bayesian methods. Sparse estimation is also important in unsupervised method (sparse PCA, etc.). Recent machine learning techniques for multi-task learning and collaborative filtering have been proposed which implement sparsity constraints on matrices (rank, structured sparsity, etc.). At the same time, sparsity is playing an important role in various application fields, ranging from image and video reconstruction and compression, to speech classification, text and sound analysis, etc.\n\nThe overall goal of the workshop is to bring together machine learning researchers with statisticians working on this timely topic of research, to encourage exchange of ideas between both communities and discuss further developments and theoretical underpinning of the methods.

However, the representation of user queries and resource content in existing search appliances is still almost exclusively achieved by simple syntax‐based descriptions of the resource content and the information need such as in the predominant keyword-centric paradigm (i.e. keyword queries matched against bag‐of‐words document representation).\n\nOn the other hand, recent advances in the field of semantic technologies have resulted in tools and standards that allow for the articulation of domain knowledge in a formal manner at a high level of expressivity. At the same time, semantic repositories and reasoning engines have only now advanced to a state where querying and processing of this knowledge can scale to realistic IR scenarios.\n\nIn parallel to these developments, in the past years we have also seen the emergence of important results in adapting ideas from IR to the problem of search in RDF/OWL data, folksonomies, microformat collections or semantically tagged natural text. Common to these scenarios is that the search is focused not on a document collection, but on metadata (which may be possibly linked to or embedded in textual information). Search and ranking in metadata stores is another key topic addressed by the workshop.\n\nAs such, semantic technologies are now in a state to provide significant contributions to IR problems.\nIn this context, several challenges arise for Semantic Search systems. These include, among others:\n\n  * How can semantic technologies be exploited to capture the information need of the user?\n  * How can the information need of the user be translated to expressive formal queries without enforcing the user to be capable of handling the difficult query syntax?\n  * How can expressive resource descriptions be extracted (acquired) from documents (users)?\n  * How can expressive resource descriptions be stored and queried efficiently on a large scale?\n  * How can vague information needs and incomplete resource descriptions be handled?\n  * How can semantic search systems be evaluated and compared with standard IR systems?\n'

From the viewpoint of a road operator, this will lead to accelerated damage to bridges and pavement fatigue as well as creating major traffic management problems to maintain safety and reduce congestion. For truck operators, there are the combined challenges of reducing ever increasing fuel costs, maximising efficiency and profitability whilst maintaining safety. For truck drivers, they have the additional tasks of charting a safe and appropriate route.\n\nThe FP6 project “Heavyroute” is based on the belief that one major support for all three parties could come from the improvement in the generation and usage of maps for trucks in Europe. The use of mapping systems based on satellite guidance has increased dramatically and is providing major benefits to professional drivers. However there are many stories of drivers finding themselves on inappropriate routes for their vehicle, using current systems.\n\nWorking with all the major stakeholders, the Heavyroute project worked to provide the tools, the systems and the data collection and interpretation processes that will effectively link Europe´s road infrastructure via electronic mapping systems to the truck operators and drivers. This will provide a major boost to the efficiency, profitability and safety of the haulage sector whilst contributing to overall road safety and congestion and infrastructure asset management objectives.\n\nThree main applications were developed based on vehicle/infrastructure interaction models together with\ndetailed data on the vehicle itself, the infrastructure and the traffic.\n\n**1.

Relevant problems include sensor modeling, manipulation, control, and many others. A large number of function approximation methods have been proposed from statistics, machine learning, and control system theory to address robotics-related issues such as online updates, active sampling, high dimensionality, non-homogeneous noise, and missing features.\n\nIn this workshop, we would like to develop a common understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of different function approximation approaches and to derive practical guidelines for selecting a suitable approach to a given problem.\n\nIn addition, we would like to discuss two key points of criticism in current robot learning research. First, data-driven machine learning methods do, in fact, not necessarily outperform models designed by human experts and we would like to explore what function approximation problems in robotics really have to be learned. Second, function approximation/regression methods are typically evaluated using different metrics and data sets, making standardized comparisons challenging.\n\n----\nThe conference homepage can be found at http://robreg.org\n----'

Common to all conferences are the showcasing of good practices and the contribution of a wide range of actors from education, research, business, culture, and the arts, including both the public and the private sectors.\n\n\n\nThe main characteristic of this second conference is its regional/local approach. In other terms, the conference should explore creativity and innovation from a people\'s point of view, demonstrating how they relate to everyday life and to societal priorities and concerns.\n\n\nThe three themes chosen to this end are employment, wellbeing and education. There are clear linkages between all three, and the conference should highlight this mutual dependence, and the need for holistic approaches.\n\n\nTo this end, each theme will be presented by an expert in the subject, and it will be illustrated by means of a selected number of cases of good practice. It will be a specialised conference, addressing policy makers, practitioners, academia and business. The parallel workshops will be structured as panels, to stimulate and facilitate a debate and produce policy conclusions\n\n\nFor employment, the key message is how creativity and innovation contribute to the creation of new jobs. Good practices will be chosen in areas with high growth potential such as soft energies, health services, waste management, communication services or the creative industries. A second important message is the fact that these new jobs are often quality jobs. \n\n\nFor wellbeing, the key message is how creativity and innovation contribute to a better quality of life for all. Good practices will be chosen in areas of high societal impact and relevance such as health, clean cities, leisure activities or advanced social services.\n\n\nFor education, the key message is how education and learning are the source of creativity and innovation and how important is to build them in as core values of education and training systems in Europe. A second key message is the need of \"new skills for new jobs\". Good practices would be linked to essential sectors for creativity and innovation such as science, ICT, entrepreneurship and the arts.\n\n\nAll three areas are closely interrelated, as selected good practices will demonstrate. This interrelationship will also drive the conference\'s organization, by a holistic approach to the description and analysis of projects as well as by providing opportunities for cross-disciplinary debate.

9604,'event','en',374,'2009-09-05','2009-10-05','Third International Workshop on Machine Learning in Systems Biology','Molecular biology and all the biomedical sciences are undergoing a true revolution as a result of the emergence and growing impact of a series of new disciplines/tools sharing the “-omics” suffix in their name. These include in particular genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, devoted respectively to the examination of the entire systems of genes, transcripts, proteins and metabolites present in a given cell or tissue type.\n\nThe availability of these new, highly effective tools for biological exploration is dramatically changing the way one performs research in at least two respects. First, the amount of available experimental data is not a limiting factor any more; on the contrary, there is a plethora of it. Given the research question, the challenge has shifted towards identifying the relevant pieces of information and making sense out of it (a “data mining” issue). Second, rather than focus on components in isolation, we can now try to understand how biological systems behave as a result of the integration and interaction between the individual components that one can now monitor simultaneously (so called “systems biology”).\n\nTaking advantage of this wealth of “genomic” information has become a ‘conditio sine qua non’ for whoever ambitions to remain competitive in molecular biology and in the biomedical sciences in general. Machine learning naturally appears as one of the main drivers of progress in this context, where most of the targets of interest deal with complex structured objects: sequences, 2D and 3D structures or interaction networks. At the same time bioinformatics and systems biology have already induced significant new developments of general interest in machine learning, for example in the context of learning with structured data, graph inference, semi-supervised learning, system identification, and novel combinations of optimization and learning algorithms.\n\nThe aim of this workshop is to contribute to the cross-fertilization between the research in machine learning methods and their applications to systems biology (i.e., complex biological and medical questions) by bringing together method developers and experimentalists.\n\nThe Workshop is organized as \"core - event\" of Patterns Analysis, Statistical Modelling and Computational Learning - Network of Excellence 2 (PASCAL 2).\n\n----\nMore about the workshop can be found at: http://mlsb09.ijs.si/index.html\n----'

Če želimo mladim generacijam zagotoviti ustrezno splošno izobrazbo za življenje in aktivno državljanstvo v 21. stoletju, moramo našim učiteljem omogočiti, da se sproti seznanjajo z novostmi v biologiji in z družbenimi vidiki uporabe biološkega znanja. Temu je bil letos že tretje leto zapored namenjen mednarodni posvet Biološka znanost in družba.\n\nV Darwinovem letu 2009, ko v svetovnem merilu praznujemo 200. obletnico rojstva Charlesa\nDarwina in 150. obletnico izida njegove knjige O nastanku vrst z naravnim izborom, je osrednja tema\nposveta evolucija kot proces, s katerim nastaja biodiverziteta ali biotska pestrost. Sodobne poglede na\nto tematiko so udeležencem posveta predstavili priznani slovenski in tuji raziskovalci s področja\nbioloških in družboslovnih znanosti. Ob zaključku vsakega dneva posveta je bila okrogla miza, na kateri so udeleženci sodelovali v razpravah s strokovnjaki za posamezna znanstvena področja.\n\nLetošnji posvet sta spremljala dva dogodka, povezana s praznovanjem Darwinovega leta. V avli pred konferenčno dvorano je bila ogled razstava Darwin Now. V času posveta je izšel slovenski prevod knjige Eve Jablonke in Marion J. Lamb: Evolucija v štirih dimenzijah. Soavtorica knjige prof. Eva Jablonka je na posvetu tudi predavala.\n\n----\nVeč o posvetu na domači strani: http://www.zrss.si/bzid/biodiverziteta/\n----\n;[[http://www.zrss.si/bzid/biodiverziteta/pdf/Zbornik_BZID_Biodiverziteta_2009_splet.pdf|Zbornik posveta Biološka znanost in družba, Biodiverziteta]]\n----\n\nSeznam angleških predavanj z dodanimi zvočnimi posnetki v slovenščini:\n\n;[[http://videolectures.net/bzid09_bell_bizs/|Biološka izobrazba za 21. stoletje: izobraževanje nove generacije za družbo prihodnosti]]\n;[[http://videolectures.net/bzid09_boyd_mcd/|Mladi Charles Darwin – študent, naravoslovec in vrtnar]]\n;[[http://videolectures.net/bzid09_jablonka_gvk/|Gen v kontekstu: od razvojne plastičnosti do plastičnega dedovanja]]\n;[[http://videolectures.net/bzid09_kuever_ezvm/|Evolucija z vidika mikrobov]]\n;[[http://videolectures.net/bzid09_page_vicar_pn/|Pozdravni nagovor]]\n;[[http://videolectures.net/bzid09_szathmary_vpve/|Veliki prehodi v evoluciji]]\n;[[http://videolectures.net/bzid09_zrimec_pom/|Prva okrogla miza]]\n;[[http://videolectures.net/bzid09_zrimec_dom/|Druga okrogla miza]]\n;[[http://videolectures.net/bzid09_setala_ueko/|Urbana ekologija – zakaj se njen pomen povečuje?]]\n;[[http://videolectures.net/bzid09_fry_nznz/|Nastanek življenja na zemlji: misterij ali znanstveni problem?]]\n----'

Svojo aktivnost bo IAS dopolnila še z enim posvetovanjem v mesecu novembru z naslovom: » Realne možnosti tehnološkega razvoja Slovenije«.\n\nNamen posvetovanja je bil osvetliti položaj in vlogo inženirjev in naravoslovcev v družbi in pregledati možnosti, kako s povečanjem prisotnosti inženirjev na vseh ravneh odločanja prispevati k preboju v razvoju, ki bi temeljil na lastnem znanju. IAS je prepričana, da je osnova za preskok v družbo znanja le razvoj lastnih novih izdelkov, ki temeljijo na lastnem tehnološkem znanju in tesnem sodelovanju raziskovalno-razvojne sfere z gospodarstvom. Brez bistvenega povečanja števila inženirjev in naravoslovcev na vodstvenih in vodilnih mestih v gospodarstvu, zlasti v njegovih raziskovalno-razvojnih enotah, napredek in še manj preskok ne bosta mogoča!

The professional participation and the stimulating debates we had in Lucerne, involving the audience and the speakers, proved that the risk was worth taking. Alongside the community of ICT researchers and EU projects consortium members there is a high-valuable community of stakeholders in logistics who have requirements and ideas to help us pursuing real and valuable innovations in this field.\n\n**Scope**\n\nThe conference will take a look into different subjects mostly dealing with the lack of available information in transport logistics and will explain how ICT can support operations and overcome information gaps between stakeholders. Topics of the conference include currently met and future challenges that need to be addressed, and cover business and technical issues in parallel tracks, e.g. strategic supply chain and tactical logistics operation enhancement through interoperable ICT implementations and possible impacts on business models, software and hardware technologies for implementation of interoperable information systems and available standards as well as security.\n\nThe event is organized in interactive sessions for possible participation of and discussions with the audience to also gather feedback and sharpen the view on changing challenges and requirements.\nSpeakers in the sessions are experts on the topics and will come from the addressed audience, e.g. logistics operators and service providers, industry, researchers, authorities and infrastructure providers, and the supporting projects.\n\n----\nThe conference homepage can be found at [[https://www.ecitl.eu/index.php|ECITL 2009]]\n----'

In particular, biological data are often relationally structured and highly diverse, well-suited to approaches that combine multiple weak evidence from heterogeneous sources. These data may include sequenced genomes of a variety of organisms, gene expression data from multiple technologies, protein expression data, protein sequence and 3D structural data, protein interactions, gene ontology and pathway databases, genetic variation data (such as SNPs), and an enormous amount of textual data in the biological and medical literature. New types of scientific and clinical problems require the development of novel supervised and unsupervised learning methods that can use these growing resources. Furthermore, next generation sequencing technologies are yielding terabyte scale data sets that require novel algorithmic solutions. The goal of this workshop is to present emerging problems and machine learning techniques in computational biology.\n----\nThe Workshop homepage can be found at http://www.mlcb.org/.\n----'
11288,'event section','en',11075,'2009-12-11','2010-01-19','Clustering','**Clustering: Science or Art? Towards Principled Approaches**\n\nThis workshop aims at initiating a dialog between theoreticians and practitioners, aiming to bridge the theory-practice gap in this area. The workshop will be built along three main question: FROM THEORY TO PRACTICE: Which abstract theoretical characterizations / properties / statements about clustering algorithms exist that can be helpful for practitioners and should be adopted in practice? FROM PRACTICE TO THEORY: What concrete questions would practitioners like to see addressed by theoreticians? Can we identify de-facto practices in clustering in need of theoretical grounding? Which obscure (but seemingly needed or useful) practices are in need of rationalization? FROM ART TO SCIENCE: In contrast to supervised learning, where there is general consensus on how to assess the quality of an algorithm, the frameworks for analyzing clustering are only beginning to be developed and clustering is still largely an art. How can we progress towards a deeper understanding of the space of clustering problems and objectives, including the introduction of falsifiable hypotheses and properly designed experimentation? How could one set up a clustering challenge to compare different clustering algorithms? What could be scientific standards to evaluate a clustering algorithm in a paper? The workshop will also serve as a follow up meeting to the NIPS 2005 “Theoretical Foundations of clustering” workshop, a venue for the different research groups working on these issues to take stock, exchange view points and discuss the next challenges in this ambitious quest for theoretical foundations of clustering.\n----\nThe Workshop homepage can be found at http://clusteringtheory.org/.\n----'
11289,'event section','en',11288,'2009-12-11','2010-01-19','Probabilistic Approaches','**Probabilistic Approaches for Robotics and Control**\n\nDuring the last decade, many areas of Bayesian machine learning have reached a high level of maturity. This has resulted in a variety of theoretically sound and efficient algorithms for learning and inference in the presence of uncertainty. However, in the context of control, robotics, and reinforcement learning, uncertainty has not yet been treated with comparable rigor despite its central role in risk-sensitive control, sensori-motor control, robust control, and cautious control. A consistent treatment of uncertainty is also essential when dealing with stochastic policies, incomplete state information, and exploration strategies. A typical situation where uncertainty comes into play is when the exact state transition dynamics are unknown and only limited or no expert knowledge is available and/or affordable. One option is to learn a model from data. However, if the model is too far off, this approach can result in arbitrarily bad solutions. This model bias can be sidestepped by the use of flexible model-free methods. The disadvantage of model-free methods is that they do not generalize and often make less efficient use of data. Therefore, they often need more trials than feasible to solve a problem on a real-world system. A probabilistic model could be used for efficient use of data while alleviating model bias by explicitly representing and incorporating uncertainty. The use of probabilistic approaches requires (approximate) inference algorithms, where Bayesian machine learning can come into play. Although probabilistic modeling and inference conceptually fit into this context, they are not widespread in robotics, control, and reinforcement learning. Hence, this workshop aims to bring researchers together to discuss the need, the theoretical properties, and the practical implications of probabilistic methods in control, robotics, and reinforcement learning. One particular focus will be on probabilistic reinforcement learning approaches that profit recent developments in optimal control which show that the problem can be substantially simplified if certain structure is imposed. The simplifications include linearity of the (Hamilton-Jacobi) Bellman equation. The duality with Bayesian estimation allow for analytical computation of the optimal control laws and closed form expressions of the optimal value functions. \n\n----\nThe Workshop homepage can be found at http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/marc/nipsWS09.\n----'
11290,'event section','en',11289,'2009-12-11','2010-01-19','Language Learning','**Grammar Induction, Representation of Language and Language Learning**\n\nNow is the time to revisit some of the fundamental grammar/language learning tasks such as grammar acquisition, language acquisition, language change, and the general problem of automatically inferring generic representations of language structure in a data driven manner. Though the underlying problems have been known to be computationally intractable for the standard representations of the Chomsky hierarchy, such as regular grammars and context free grammars, progress has been made by modifying or restricting these classes to make them more observable. Generalisations of distributional learning have shown promise in unsupervised learning of linguistic structure using tree based representations, or using non-parametric approaches to inference. More radically, significant advances in this domain have been made by switching to different representations such as the work in Clark, Eyrand & Habrard (2008) that addresses the issue of language acquisition, but has the potential to cross-fertilise a wide range of problems that require data driven representations of language. Such approaches are starting to make inroads into one of the fundamental problems of cognitive science: that of learning complex representations that encode meaning. This adds a further motivation for returning to this topic at this point. Grammar induction was the subject of an intense study in the early days of Computational Learning Theory, with the theory of query learning largely developing out of this research. More recently the study of new methods of representing language and grammars through complex kernels and probabilistic modelling together with algorithms such as structured output learning has enabled machine learning methods to be applied successfully to a range of language related tasks from simple topic classification through parts of speech tagging to statistical machine translation. These methods typically rely on more fluid structures than those derived from formal grammars and yet are able to compete favourably with classical grammatical approaches that require significant input from domain experts, often in the form of annotated data.\n----\nThe Workshop homepage can be found at http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/rmartin/grll09/\n----'
11291,'event section','en',11290,'2009-12-12','2010-01-19','Learning from Multiple Sources','**Learning from Multiple Sources with Applications to Robotics**\n\nLearning from multiple sources denotes the problem of jointly learning from a set of (partially) related learning problems / views / tasks. This general concept underlies several subfields receiving increasing interest from the machine learning community, which differ in terms of the assumptions made about the dependency structure between learning problems. In particular, the concept includes topics such as data fusion, transfer learning, multitask learning, multiview learning, and learning under covariate shift. Several approaches for inferring and exploiting complex relationships between data sources have been presented, including both generative and discriminative approaches.\n\nThe workshop will provide a unified forum for cutting edge research on learning from multiple sources; the workshop will examine the general concept, theory and methods, and will also examine robotics as a natural application domain for learning from multiple sources. The workshop will address methodological challenges in the different subtopics and further interaction between them. The intended audience is researchers working in fields of multi-modal learning, data fusion, and robotics.\n----\nThe Workshop homepage can be found at http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~srogers/lms09/index.htm\n----'
11292,'event section','en',11075,'2009-12-12','2010-01-19','Optimization','**Optimization for Machine Learning**\n\nIt is fair to say that at the heart of every machine learning algorithm is an optimization problem. It is only recently that this viewpoint has gained significant following. Classical optimization techniques based on convex optimization have occupied center-stage due to their attractive theoretical properties. But, new non-smooth and non-convex problems are being posed by machine learning paradigms such as structured learning and semi-supervised learning. Moreover, machine learning is now very important for real-world problems which often have massive datasets, streaming inputs, and complex models that also pose significant algorithmic and engineering challenges. In summary, machine learning not only provides interesting applications but also challenges the underlying assumptions of most existing optimization algorithms. Therefore, there is a pressing need for optimization \"tuned\" to the machine learning context. For example, techniques such as non-convex optimization (for semi-supervised learning), combinatorial optimization and relaxations (structured learning), non-smooth optimization (sparsity constraints, L1, Lasso, structure learning), stochastic optimization (massive datasets, noisy data), decomposition techniques (parallel and distributed computation), and online learning (streaming inputs) are relevant in this setting. These techniques naturally draw inspiration from other fields, such as operations research, theoretical computer science, and the optimization community. Motivated by these concerns, we would like to address these issues in the framework of this workshop.\n----\nThe Workshop homepage can be found at http://opt.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/\n----'

In sensor networks, for example, missing signals from temporal failing sensors may be predicted due to correlations with signals acquired from other sensors. In geo-statistics, prediction of the concentration of heavy pollutant metals (for example, Copper concentration), that require expensive procedures to be measured, can be done using inexpensive and oversampled variables (for example, pH data). Multi-task learning is a general learning framework in which it is assumed that learning multiple tasks simultaneously leads to better modeling results and performance that learning the same tasks individually. Exploiting correlations and dependencies among tasks, it becomes possible to handle common practical situations such as missing data or to increase the amount of potential data when only few amount of data per task is available. In this workshop we will consider the use of kernel methods for multiple outputs and multi-task learning. The aim of the workshop is to bring together Bayesian and frequentist researchers to establish common ground and shared goals.\n----\nThe Workshop homepage can be found at http://intranet.cs.man.ac.uk/mlo/mock09/.\n----'

Learning the parameters of undirected models plays a crucial role in solving key problems in many machine learning applications, including natural language processing, visual object recognition, speech perception, information retrieval, computational biology, and many others. Learning in undirected graphical models of large treewidth is difficult because of the hard inference problem induced by the partition function for maximum likelihood learning, or by finding the MAP assignment for margin-based loss functions. Over the last decade, there has been considerable progress in developing algorithms for approximating the partition function and MAP assignment, both via variational approaches (e.g., belief propagation) and sampling algorithms (e.g., MCMC). More recently, researchers have begun to apply these methods to learning large, densely-connected undirected graphical models that may contain millions of parameters. A notable example is the learning of Deep Belief Networks and Deep Boltzmann Machines, that employ MCMC strategy to greedily learn deep hierarchical models.\n----\nThe Workshop homepage can be found at http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rsalakhu/workshop_nips2009/index.html.\n----'
11295,'event section','en',11287,'2009-12-12','2010-01-19','Structured Data','**Transfer Learning for Structured Data**\n\nRecently, transfer learning (TL) has gained much popularity as an approach to reduce the training-data calibration effort as well as improve generalization performance of learning tasks. Unlike traditional learning, transfer learning methods make the best use of data from one or more source tasks in order to learn a target task. Many previous works on transfer learning have focused on transferring the knowledge across domains where the data are assumed to be i.i.d. In many real-world applications, such as identifying entities in social networks or classifying Web pages, data are often intrinsically non i.i.d., which present a major challenge to transfer learning. In this workshop, we call for papers on the topic of transfer learning for structured data. Structured data are those that have certain intrinsic structures such as network topology, and present several challenges to knowledge transfer. A first challenge is how to judge the relatedness between tasks and avoid negative transfer. Since data are non i.i.d., standard methods for measuring the distance between data distributions, such as KL divergence, Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and A-distance, may not be applicable. A second challenge is that the target and source data may be heterogeneous. For example, a source domain is a bioinformatics network, while a target domain may be a network of webpage. In this case, deep transfer or heterogeneous transfer approaches are required. Heterogeneous transfer learning for structured data is a new area of research, which concerns transferring knowledge between different tasks where the data are non-i.i.d. and may be even heterogeneous. This area has emerged as one of the most promising areas in machine learning. In this workshop, we wish to boost the research activities of knowledge transfer across structured data in the machine learning community. We welcome theoretical and applied disseminations that make efforts (1) to expose novel knowledge transfer methodology and frameworks for transfer mining across structured data. (2) to investigate effective (automated, human-machined-cooperated) principles and techniques for acquiring, representing, modeling and engaging transfer learning on structured data in real-world applications. This workshop on Transfer learning for structured data will bring active researchers in artificial intelligence, machine learning and data mining together toward developing methods or systems together, to explore methods for solving real-world problems associated with learning on structured data. The workshop invites researchers interested in transfer learning, statistical relational learning and structured data mining to contribute their recent works on the topic of interest.\n----\nThe Workshop homepage can be found at http://www.cse.ust.hk/~sinnopan/nips09tlsd/index.html.\n----'

A particularly recurrent temporal structure in real applications is the so-called change-point model, where the data may be temporally partitioned into a sequence of segments delimited by change-points, such that a single model holds within each segment whereas different models hold accross segments. Change-point problems may be tackled from two points of view, corresponding to the practical problem at hand: retrospective (or \"a posteriori\"), aka multiple change-point estimation, where the whole signal is taken at once and the goal is to estimate the change-point locations, and online (or sequential), aka quickest detection, where data are observed sequentially and the goal is to quickly detect change-points. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together experts from the statistics, machine learning, signal processing communities, to address a broad range of applications from robotics to neuroscience, to discuss and cross-fertilize ideas, and to define the current challenges in temporal segmentation.\n----\nThe Workshop homepage can be found at http://www.harchaoui.eu/zaid/workshops/nips09/index.html\n----'

Indeed, the pace of innovation in these areas prevents proper coverage by conferences of broader scope. The high attendance at the first two WSDMs, held at Stanford University and Barcelona in February 2008 and 2009, has confirmed community interest in a more focused venue.\n\nWSDM publishes original, high quality submissions related to search and data mining on the Web, with an emphasis on practical but principled novel models of search and retrieval, algorithm design and analysis, economics implications, and in-depth experimental analysis of accuracy and performance.\n\nWSDM is co-sponsored by ACM SIGIR, SIGKDD, SIGMOD, and SIGWEB.\n----\nThe Conference homepage can be found [[http://www.wsdm-conference.org/2010/|here]]\n----'

Beyond the outstanding first-class scientific value of their stay, the selected students will find working in a multidisciplinary and multicultural environment an extremely enriching personal experience. It is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make valuable and long lasting contacts with other students and scientists from all over Europe.\n\nIn addition to the work in the experimental teams, Summer Students attend a series of lectures specially prepared for them. Several scientists from around the world share their knowledge about a wide range of topics in the fields of theoretical and experimental particle physics and computing. Visits to the accelerators and experimental areas are also part of the Program, as well as discussion sessions, workshops and a poster session. Students are required to prepare a short report on their work at CERN which should be submitted at the end of their stay. Students come for between 8 weeks (minimum stay) to 13 weeks (maximum stay) and the possible dates of stay are available here.\n\nDetailed information on the summer student programme and activities can be found here.\n\n[[http://indico.cern.ch/tools/SSLPdisplay.py?stdate=2009-06-29&nbweeks=8|Summer Student Lecture Programme 2009]]\n\n'

They have often been studied in different sub-communities, but over the past decade, there has been increasing interest in trying to understand and leverage the advantages of both approaches. The goal of this workshop is to map out our current understanding of the empirical and theoretical advantages of each approach as well as their combination, and to identify open research directions.\n\nThe aim of this workshop is to provide a platform for both theoretical and applied researchers from different communities to discuss the status of our understanding on the interplay between generative and discriminative learning, as well as to identify forward-looking open problems of interest to the NIPS community. Examples of topics of interest to the workshop are as follows:\n\n  * Theoretical analysis of generative vs. discriminative learning\n  * Techniques for combining generative and discriminative approaches\n  * Successful applications of hybrids\n  * Empirical comparison of generative vs. discriminative learning\n  * Inclusion of prior knowledge in discriminative methods (semi-supervised approaches, generalized expectation criteria, posterior regularization, etc.)\n  * Insights into the role of generative/discriminative interface for deep learning\n  * Computational issues in discriminatively trained generative models/hybrid models\n  * Map of possible generative/discriminative approaches and combinations\n  * Bayesian approaches optimized for predictive performance\n  * Comparison of model-free and model-based approaches in statistics or reinforcement learning\n\n----\nThe Workshop homepage can be found at http://gen-disc2009.wikidot.com/.\n----\n'

Over four remarkable decades, UCI has become internationally recognized for efforts that are improving lives through research and discovery, fostering excellence in scholarship and teaching, and engaging and enriching the community.\n\nUCI is among the fastest-growing campuses in the UC system. Increasingly a first-choice campus for students, UCI attracts record numbers of undergraduate applications each year and admits freshmen with highly competitive academic profiles. UCI is a center for quality education and is consistently ranked among the nation’s best universities. Achievements in the sciences, arts, humanities, medicine, and management have garnered top 50 national rankings for more than 40 academic programs. Three UCI researchers have won Nobel Prizes—two in chemistry and one in physics.\n\nThe University launched its OpenCourseWare initiative in November 2006. As the first West Coast university and UC campus to join the OpenCourseWare Consortium (OCWC), our OCW project is growing rapidly with the addition of nearly10 new courses every month. Many of our OCW offerings are directed at working adults seeking continuing education, with the option to enroll in instructor-led, for-credit courses, related to the OCW content. Our OCW initiative is supported partly by funding from extra-mural sponsors like the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation—funding that has allowed for the development of OCW created specifically or targeted audiences such as California public school teachers seeking help in passing state examinations for single-subject science and mathematics credentials. In addition, our OCW Web site also provides students and self learners around the globe with access to UCI-faculty created undergraduate and graduate courses that are currently being taught to matriculated UCI students.\n\nLearn more [[http://ocw.uci.edu/|UC Irvine, OpenCourseWare]]'

Je uradni jezik države Slovenije in Evropske unije, iz leta v leto se povečuje število njegovih govorcev in govork. Toda za polno delovanje jezika v sodobnih razmerah je nujno, da je dobro opremljen, zlasti če si želimo bogato jezikovno življenje tudi v naslednjih desetletjih. Dobra opremljenost pomeni usposobljenost jezika in govorcev za vse, tudi najzahtevnejše jezikovne in sporazumevalne naloge. Za to so na prvem mestu potrebni kakovostni, ustrezni in zanesljivi podatki o jeziku, o jezikovnih navadah in potrebah govorečih. Šele s takimi podatki lahko zasnujemo dobre in delujoče jezikovne priročnike, pa tudi druge jezikovne pripomočke, ki jih omogoča sodobna tehnologija in uporabnikom jezika lajšajo vsakdanje življenje.\n\n Slovensko prizorišče je bilo v zadnjem desetletju glede uveljavljanja sodobnih tehnologij pri zbiranju in obdelovanju jezikovnih podatkov kar živahno. L. 1998 je bilo ustanovljeno Slovensko društvo za jezikovne tehnologije, ki je odslej - med drugim - vsaki dve leti soorganiziralo konferenco Jezikovne tehnologije za slovenski jezik. Različne ustanove in nekatera podjetja v Sloveniji lahko pokažejo bogato bero akademskih in uporabnih rezultatov s področja jezikovnih virov in tehnologij. Po drugi strani pa se zdi v Sloveniji še vedno premalo uveljavljeno temeljno spoznanje, da brez kvalitetnih virov in upoštevanja dejanskih potreb jezikovne skupnosti ni mogoče pričakovati nadaljnjega polnega razvoja slovenščine, slovenske jezikovne skuposti, pa tudi države Slovenije ne.\n\nS posvetom želimo zato po eni strani opozoriti širšo javnost na dosežke in načrte jezikovnotehnološke skupnosti v Sloveniji. Po drugi strani pa želimo odpreti debato o tem, katere potrebe in nadaljnji cilji so vsem akterjem skupni in jih bomo torej morda lahko opredelili kot stvar nacionalnega interesa, kateri cilji pa so bolj zadeva komercialnih in akademskih interesov posameznih akterjev.\n\nPosvet bo potekal v obliki moderiranega pogovora, h kateremu so vabljeni vsi zainteresirani.

Tufte**\n\n**English:**\nIn 2009 and 2010 an extremely important area of design – information design – will be presented to the Slovene expert public (designers, architects, advertisers, psychologists, linguists, students), as well as other interested public (state institutions, publishing and media houses, pharmaceutical and other industries). Information design is one of the broadest areas of visual communication that every member of our society encounters on every step and every day: in public transport (traffic signs, schedules, maps, pictograms), public urban spaces (directional systems in airports, hospitals, museums, hotels, etc.), healthcare, medicine and pharmaceutical industry (medicine packaging, expert medical and didactic tools), information technologies (the internet, displays on products), telecommunication technologies and media (telephones, newspapers, television), education and science (educational publications, presentations and explanations of complex scientific topics) and in many other areas.\n\nIn Slovenia, information design is a deficient and largely undeveloped branch of visual communications. Because of the specifics and undefined character of these projects, Slovene designers often do not have a possibility to take part in these activities, whereas on the other hand clients often do not know the advantages of the incorporation of creative industries that could lead to better results.\n\nTherefore the lectures have been planned based on very rational decisions and reasons. Information design translates complex, unorganised and unstructured data into useful and understandable information; it places greater emphasis on readability, clarity and final applicability of documents. Clarity and unambiguous message of information is extremely important in today’s ever more complex society that overflows with various data. One such example of how important information design can be are voting ballots for American presidential elections in Florida in 2000: it is a known fact that poorly designed ballots caused confusion among voters and were therefore incorrectly filled out, resulting in the exclusion of those ballots and the eight-year term of office of George W. Bush. If the ballots had been suitably designed and therefore valid, Al Gore and not George W. Bush would have most probably won the 2000 presidential elections. Information design can therefore help shape transparent information in public sector and facilitate democratic communication of topics that are relevant for the local and global society.\n\nIn the Architecture Museum lectures, information design will be presented to Slovene public by six internationally renowned experts in the area of information design, who will speak about the selection, visualisation, interpretation and communication of data. The lecturers will be Yuri Engelhardt (the Netherlands), Rob Waller (Great Britain), Karel van der Waarde (Belgium) and others.\n\nUnlike in many other areas of visual communications, what is of key importance in the process of information design is interdisciplinary blending of experiences and knowledge from the areas of graphic design, psychology, applied linguistics, architecture, information technologies, writing, editing and many other areas. For this reason invitations to the lectures will not be sent only to designers, but also to other experts whose participation is urgently needed for successful solutions in information design. Lectures will not be only educational, but will also be an opportunity to bring together different experts and areas of expertise that should collaborate in information design. For this purpose both experts from different areas and representatives of various companies and state institutions will be regularly invited to the lectures.\n\nMore about the event at [[http://www.aml.si/tw/education/museum-evenings/on-information-design-series.html|Architecture Museum of Ljubljana]]\n\n**Slovensko:**\nV letu 2009/2010 bomo slovenski strokovni javnosti (oblikovalcem, arhitektom, oglaševalcem, psihologom, lingvistom, študentom) in tudi ostali zainteresirani javnosti (npr. državnim ustanovam, založniškim in medijskim hišam, farmacevtski in drugim industrijam) predstavili izjemno pomembno področje oblikovanja – informacijsko oblikovanje. Gre za eno najširših področij vizualnih komunikacij, s katerim se vsak član naše družbe srečuje na vsakem koraku vsakega dneva: v javnem prevozu (prometni znaki, vozni redi, zemljevidi, piktogrami), javnih urbanih prostorih (usmerjevalni sistemi na letališčih, v bolnišnicah, muzejih, hotelih itn.), v zdravstvu, medicini in farmaciji (embalaža zdravil, strokovni medicinski in didaktični pripomočki), pri informacijskih tehnologijah (internet, prikazovalniki na izdelkih), v telekomunikacijskih tehnologijah in medijih (telefonski aparati, časopisi, televizija), v izobraževanju in znanosti (izobraževalne publikacije, prikazi in razlage kompleksnih znanstvenih vsebin) ter na številnih drugih področjih.\n\n  V slovenskem prostoru je informacijsko oblikovanje precej deficitarna in pretežno nerazvita veja vizualnih komunikacij. Slovenski oblikovalci se zaradi specifike in nedefiniranosti tovrstnih projektov dostikrat nimajo možnosti vključevati v omenjene aktivnosti, po drugi strani pa naročniki pogosto ne poznajo prednosti vključevanja kreativnih industrij, ki bi lahko vodile v izboljšanje rezultatov.\n\n  V ozadju načrtovanja predavanj, ki jih pripravljamo, ležijo zelo racionalne odločitve in razlogi. Informacijsko oblikovanje prevaja kompleksne, neorganizirane in nestrukturirane podatke v koristne in razumljive informacije; pri tem je poudarek na čitljivosti, razumljivosti in končni uporabnosti dokumentov. Jasnost in nedvoumnost informacije je v današnjem času, ko družba postaja vedno bolj kompleksna in prenasičena z različnimi podatki, izjemnega pomena. Kako pomembno je informacijsko oblikovanje, nam izvrstno ilustrira primer glasovnic za ameriške predsedniške volitve s Floride iz leta 2000: kot je znano, so zaradi slabega oblikovanja povzročile zmedo pri volivcih in nepravilno izpolnjevanje, kar je imelo za posledico množično razveljavitev glasovnic in osemletno predsednikovanje Georgea W. Busha; precej verjetno je namreč, da bi v primeru ustrezno oblikovanih oziroma nerazveljavljenih glasovnic na predsedniških volitvah leta 2000 zmagal Al Gore, in ne George W. Bush. Informacijsko oblikovanje lahko torej pripomore tudi k transparentni informaciji v javnem sektorju in k demokratičnemu sporočanju vsebin, ki zadevajo lokalno in globalno družbo.\n\n  Na predavanjih v Arhitekturnem muzeju Ljubljana bo informacijsko oblikovanje slovenski javnosti predstavila šesterica mednarodno priznanih strokovnjakov s tega področja; govorili bodo o izboru, vizualizaciji, interpretaciji in sporočanju podatkov.\n\n  V nasprotju s številnimi drugimi vejami vizualnih komunikacij je v procesih informacijskega oblikovanja ključno interdisciplinarno povezovanje izkušenj in znanj s področij grafičnega oblikovanja, psihologije, aplikativne lingvistike, arhitekture, informacijskih tehnologij, pisanja, urejanja in številnih drugih področij. Zato bodo na omenjena predavanja vabljeni ne samo oblikovalci, ampak tudi predstavniki drugih strok, katerih sodelovanje je nujno potrebno za doseganje uspešnih rešitev v informacijskem oblikovanju. Poleg izobraževalne funkcije vidimo v omenjenih predavanjih tudi priložnost za povezovanje med strokovnjaki oziroma strokami, ki naj bi sodelovale v informacijskem oblikovanju. V ta namen bomo na predavanja redno vabili tako slovenske strokovnjake iz različnih strok kot tudi predstavnike različnih podjetij in državnih ustanov.\n\nVeč o dogodku na [[http://www.aml.si/izobrazevanje/muzejski-veceri/cikel-o-informacijskem-oblikovanju.html|Arhitekturni muzej Ljubljana]]'

Slovenia, as one of the smallest EU member states, can with its research and innovation capabilities, also has significant contribution to fast developing space sector and space science. Some of the evidence to prove this, we already have. We are convinced that more intense cooperation with ESA will give impetus to faster development in the area of science, industry, and socio-economic development and culture as well. \n\nBecause of this, at the end of January has signed in the name of Republic of Slovenia an European Cooperating State Agreement - ECS with the European Space Agency (ESA), that allows Slovenia to participate in some of the ESA projects, so called PECS program. The main purpose of the Agreement is to prepare and enhance the capabilities of the county to participate with ESA on the competitive base in the future. Slovenian companies, researchers from public research organizations and students can now for the first time cooperate with ESA under the Slovenian brand name, which is a great challenge but also a great opportunity.\n \nAt the thematic event the ESA specialists will present the plans and procedures for ESA project participation. The national public call, which was launched, to gather the interest from Slovenian participants in ESA projects will be presented as well.\n\n**Ministrstvo za visoko šolstvo, znanost in tehnologijo skupaj z Gospodarsko zbornico Slovenije in Evropsko vesoljsko agencijo organizira posvet na temo Evropska vesoljska agencija odpira vrata Sloveniji**\n\n**Slovensko:** Dejavnosti na področju raziskovanja in miroljubne uporabe vesolja so v Republiki Sloveniji razmeroma živahne. Slovenija, kot ena manjših evropskih držav, lahko s svojimi podjetji in raziskovalci prav tako prispeva na področju vesoljskih dejavnosti. Nekaj dokazov za to že imamo. Prepričani smo, da bo sodelovanje z ESA v Sloveniji spodbudilo razvoj na področju znanosti, industrije in tudi kulture. \n\nKonec januarja 2010 je zato minister Gregor Golobič v imenu Republike Slovenije z Evropsko vesoljsko agencijo (ESA) podpisal sporazum Evropske sodelujoče države, ki Sloveniji omogoča sodelovanje v nekaterih konkretnih projektih Evropske vesoljske agencije, t.i. PECS program. Namen tega sporazuma je predvsem priprava in krepitev sposobnosti za sodelovanje z ESA na osnovi konkurenčnih pogojev v prihodnosti. Slovenska podjetja, raziskovalci iz institucij znanja ter študenti lahko tako sedaj prvič samostojno sodelujejo v programih ESA, kar predstavlja izziv in hkrati veliko priložnost. \n \nNa konferenci bodo strokovnjaki iz ESA predstavili načrte in postopke ESA, predstavljen pa bo tudi javni poziv, ki ga je za pridobitev predlogov s strani zainteresiranih nedavno objavilo Ministrstvo za visoko šolstvo, znanost in tehnologijo.\n\nVeč o posvetu na [[http://www.gzs.si/slo/storitve/48744|ESA odpira vrata Sloveniji]]'

But the information relevant to many important decisions in areas such as business, government, medicine and scientific research is massive, and growing at an accelerating pace. Relevant raw data is widely available on the web and other data sources, but usually in order to be useful it must be gathered, extracted, organized, and normalized into a knowledge base.\n\nHand-built knowledge bases such as Wikipedia have made us all better decision-makers. However more than human editing will be necessary to create a wide variety of domain-specific, deeply comprehensive, more highly structured knowledge bases.\n\nA variety of automated methods have begun to reach levels of accuracy and scalability that make them applicable to automatically constructing useful knowledge bases from text and other sources. These capabilities have been enabled by research in areas including natural language processing, information extraction, information integration, databases, search and machine learning. There are substantial scientific and engineering challenges in advancing and integrating such relevant methodologies.\n\nThis workshop gathered researchers in a variety of fields that contribute to the automated construction of knowledge bases.\n\nThere has recently been a tremendous amount of new work in this area, some of it in traditionally disconnected communities. In this workshop the organizers aim to bring these communities together.\n\nTopics of interest include:\n\n- information extraction; open information extraction, named entity extraction; entity resolution, relation extraction.\\\\\n- information integration; schema alignment; ontology alignment; ontology constrution.\\\\\n- monolingual alignment, alignment between knowlege bases and text.\\\\\n- joint inference between text interpretation and knowledge base\\\\\n- pattern analysis, semantic analysis of natural language, reading the web, learning by reading.\\\\\n- databases; distributed information systems; probabilistic databases.\\\\\n- scalable computation; distributed computation.\\\\\n- information retrieval; search on mixtures of structured and unstructured data; querying under uncertainty.\\\\\n- machine learning; unsupervised, lightly-supervised and distantly-supervised learning; learning from naturally-available data.\\\\\n- human-computer collaboration in knowledge base construction; automated population of wikis.\\\\\n- dynamic data, online/on-the-fly adaptation of knowledge.\\\\\n- inference; scalable approximate inference.\\\\\n- languages, toolkits and systems for automated knowledge base construction.\\\\\n- demonstrations of existing automatically-built knowledge bases.\\\\\n\nMore about the event at http://akbc.xrce.xerox.com/'

For addressing the complex multi-stakeholder and multilevel challenges associated with climate change mitigation and adaptation an appropriate knowledge base is needed not only among public authorities but also among civil society, business sector etc. in order to have problem aware constituencies in the countries of the world supporting with their attitudes and actions governments towards bold future oriented global climate change action.\n\n\nUN system plays an important role in “Teaching Climate Change” in several ways:\\\\\n•  It is obvious that a global challenge like climate change can be addressed effectively only with global coordination and cooperation among relevant stakeholders. As United Nations system (e.g. UNFCCC, UNEP, ..) is the central institutional framework for global governance responses to the climate change challenge, it is important to build capacities worldwide on the functioning of the UN system;\\\\\n•  at the same time UN organizations like UNESCO, UNITAR, UNDP etc. play an important role as provider and facilitator of climate change education and last but not least\\\\\n•  UN system plays somehow the role of a lighthouse for climate change awareness building activities of global civil society (and e.g. national UN associations) and there is a need for a strategic approach to partnerships in this area, too.\n\nThe countries in Southeast Europe are facing similar climate change challenges. On the one hand scientific climate change models predict especially serious climate change impacts in SEE but on the other hand SEE countries have also some kind of “window of opportunity” open as they are currently reforming and modernizing their socio-economic systems and governance structures in the context of EU integration processes and there is a chance to adapt relatively early to climate change in a joint effort of mobilizing national, European and official development assistance resources and to foster EU integration of the SEE region through joint climate change action.\n\nMore about the conference at http://www.investsciencesee.info/ccandun/'

ESWC2010 builds on the success of the former European Semantic Web Conference series, but seeks to extend its focus by engaging with other communities within and outside ICT, in which semantics can play an important role. At the same time, ESWC2010 is a truly international conference.\n\nSemantics of web content, enriched with domain theories (ontologies), data about web usage, natural language processing, etc. will enable a web that provides a qualitatively new level of functionality. It will weave together a large network of human knowledge and make this knowledge machine-processable. Various automated services, based on reasoning with metadata and ontologies, will help the users to achieve their goals by accessing and processing information in machine-understandable form. This network of knowledge systems will ultimately lead to truly intelligent systems, which will be employed for various complex decision-making tasks. Research about web semantics can benefit from ideas and cross-fertilization with many other areas: Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Database and Information Systems, Information Retrieval, Multimedia, Distributed Systems, Social Networks, Web Engineering, and Web Science.\n\nESWC2010 will present the latest results in research and applications in its field. The research program will be organised in targeted tracks.

Aktivnosti uspešno izvaja s pomočjo TIA - Tehnološke agencije Slovenije in MVZT - Ministrstva za visoko šolstvo, znanost in tehnologijo Republike Slovenije\n\nKonec prvega obdobja tranzicije slovenskega gospodarstva ima slovensko obrtništvo reprezentativno, neodvisno, na zakonu in obveznem članstvu utemeljeno ter po terenu izjemno razvejano stanovsko in javnopravno organizacijo za podporo obrti in podjetništva. Ob vključevanju v Evropsko unijo pa se pričenja drugo obdobje spreminjanja in prilagajanja slovenske ekonomije ostri mednarodni konkurenci v pogojih odprtih trgov blaga in storitev, kapitala in delovne sile. Zadnja leta kljub rasti ekonomske vloge malega gospodarstva zaznamujejo tudi nekateri negativni trendi v sektorju obrti in malega gospodarstva, ki jih povzročajo predvsem zaostrene in spremenjene gospodarske razmere v Sloveniji in v mednarodnem okolju, počasno prilagajanje nekaterih tradicionalnih dejavnosti spremenjenim tržnim razmeram in tehnološkim zahtevam, kot tudi vse bolj administrativno in fiskalno obremenilen odnos države.\n\nČlanstvo obrtnozborničnega sistema je zato v volilnem letu 2002 zahtevalo, da obrtniki in podjetniki, povezani v Obrtni zbornici Slovenije in območnih obrtnih zbornicah, preverimo delovanje svoje stanovske organizacije in jasneje oblikujemo svoje poglede na poslanstvo, vizijo, vlogo in mesto obrti in naše organizacije v prihodnosti.\n\nV obdobju od decembra 2002 do aprila 2003 je v organih OOZ in OZS, v strokovnih sekcijah in zadrugah, na posvetih predsednikov in sekretarjev OOZ, kot tudi v posameznih strokovnih skupinah potekala razprava o viziji in poslanstvu ter zasnovah dolgoročnega strateškega načrta razvoja obrtnozborničnega sistema za naslednje desetletno obdobje. Kot podpora razpravi o viziji OZS je bila pripravljena tudi ocena prednosti in slabosti, možnosti in nevarnosti za obrtnozbornični sistem skozi prizmo vodstva OZS ter skozi prizmo vseh 62 območnih zbornic. Prav tako je bila izdelana analiza temeljnih problemov in potreb članstva. Vizija in zasnova strateških usmeritev je bila članstvu predstavljena tudi skozi javne medije in še posebej na straneh Obrtnika ter na intranetnih straneh OZS. Razprava o viziji in strateških usmeritvah je bila zaokrožena z regijskimi posveti OOZ.\n\nV razpravah je bila dana velika podpora predlagani viziji ter zasnovi strateških usmeritev obrtnozborničnega sistema. Članstvo je zahtevalo, da njihova organizacija vloži večje napore v dvig ugleda obrti v javnosti, da strokovne službe zagotovijo večjo vlogo OZS pri nastajanju zakonodaje in zastopanju najširših interesov obrti tako na lokalni kot državni ravni, da se v zbornični sistem vključijo tudi druga mikro podjetja, ki delujejo na obrti podoben način in imajo enake probleme, kot jih imata obrt in sedanje članstvo OZS, da obrtnozbornični sistem deluje bolj povezano in učinkovito, da se bistveno več vlaga v znanje in vnašanje novih, sodobnih tehnologij tudi v obrt, da se servisno svetovalni in izobraževalni del razvijata na višji ravni, da mojstrski izpiti, ki so sicer v celoti dobili podporo, ne smejo biti prevelik omejevalni faktor za opravljanje obrtnih dejavnosti ter da je treba bistveno večji poudarek dati strokovnemu delu sekcij ter komercialnemu povezovanju članstva za bolj konkurenčno nastopanje v nabavi, proizvodnji in ponudbi (podrobno poročilo o javni razpravi o viziji in zasnovi strateških usmeritev je obravnaval upravni odbor OZS na 12. redni seji dne 22.04.2003 in naložil strokovnim službam OZS, da pripombe in predloge, ki so operativne narave in niso zajeti v strateških usmeritvah, upoštevajo pri pripravljanju letnih planov dela).\n\nVeč o OZS na http://www.ozs.si/.'

SIGKDD will encourage:\n\n  * basic research in KDD (through annual research conferences, newsletter and other related activities)\n  * adoption of \"standards\" in the market in terms of terminology, evaluation, methodology\n  * interdisciplinary education among KDD researchers, practitioners, and users\n\nSIGKDD activities include the annual Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining and the SIGKDD Explorations Newsletter. You can also read about the charter, organization, or the annual SIGKDD awards using the navigation bar on the left.\n\nMembership benefits of joining SIGKDD include: a discount in the KDD conference registration, discounts in SIGKDD partner conferences, subscription to the SIGKDD newsletter, and a chance to make a difference in the KDD field. \n\nMotivation\n\n The field of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining has grown rapidly in recent years. Massive data sets have driven research, applications, and tool development in business, science, government, and academia. The continued growth in data collection in all of these areas ensures that the fundamental problem which KDD addresses, namely how does one understand and use one\'s data, will continue to be of critical importance across a large swath of organizations.\n\nThe Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining field stands today where the database field stood about 15 years ago. There are over a 100 companies providing data-mining tools and applications, consulting and seminars, and even specialized hardware. The field is in the early adoption phase in the market, and we expect that within about 3-5 years, commercial products and the vendors will start entering the maturation phase. Within the next 10 years, in some form, the technology of data mining and knowledge discovery in data will become an integral part of the client/server enterprise information technology.\n\nComplementing business activities, there is considerable emerging research in the fields of databases, machine learning, applied statistics, visualization, and other fields relevant to data mining and knowledge discovery. This is evidenced by the recent emergence of successful KDD conferences in the US, Europe, and Asia as well as the successful launch in 1997 of the Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Journal >>. '
